# Approximation {#sec-approximation-ch}

- Inputs: function values, sampling oracle (values, derivs, integrals, etc)
- Output: Approximating function, often used for other tasks.  Plus some notion of error!
- Q to ask: what data is available?  Noise?  What is assumed about fn (smoothness, derivatives, etc)?
- What is needed from approximator (derivatives?).  How fast is fitting?  Evaluation?  Convergence?
- Discuss general theory and influence of noise later.  Focus here on piecewise polynomials and interpolation thereof.

- Polynomial interpolation and regression
- Different forms of the interpolation problem
- Choice of basis and numerical issues, computational speed
- Error analysis
- Piecewise polynomials: splines and more
- Kernel-based approximation
- Which space to use?
- Rational approximation
- Approximation of densities
