# Eigenvalue Problems and the SVD {#sec-eigenvalue-ch}

Reminder of the canonical forms; difference between the SEP, NEP, SVD
Reminder: application of eigenvalue problems.  What is actually needed?
Power method (+ PageRank as an example)

Subspace iteration
Randomized range finder

From subspace iteration to QR
Hessenberg matrices (+ control?)

Symmetric eigenvalue problem and Rayleigh quotients
Tridiagonalization
