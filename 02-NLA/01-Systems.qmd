Many applications of linear systems (including optimization)

The usual intro to LU
Role of pivoting
Cholesky (+ other areas where pivoting is not needed)
Block factorization, role of level 3 BLAS

General meaning of Schur complements
SMW and auxiliary variable formulations
Schur complements, covariance, precision, and conditioning

Condition estimation

Iterative refinement

Sparsity and dependencies
Data sparse matrices
Direct sparse solver ideas
When do direct sparse solvers make sense?
Fast and superfast solvers (fwd ref: signals)

Examples with various Markov chain computations, PageRank?
